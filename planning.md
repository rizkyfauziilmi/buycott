## Features

1. User Registration and Authentication

   - Users can log in to the platform.
   - Authentication will be implemented to ensure secure access.

2. Product Management

   - Users can add new products to the platform.
   - Products will be categorized based on their type and origin.
   - Users can verify the accuracy of product information.

3. Community Interaction

   - Users can comment on products and share their experiences.
   - A rating system will be implemented to highlight popular products.

4. Search and Filtering

   - Users can search for specific products or browse through categories.
   - Filtering options will be available to refine search results.

5. Reporting and Moderation

   - Users can report inaccurate or misleading product information.
   - Moderators will review reported content and take necessary actions.

6. Notifications

   - Users will receive notifications for product updates, comments, and moderation actions.

   ### Role-based Access Control

   In order to ensure proper security and access control, the platform will implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles. The two main roles in the system are:

   1. Admin Role

      - Admins have full access to all features and functionalities of the platform.
      - They can manage user accounts, including creating, updating, and deleting user profiles.
      - Admins can also manage products, categories, and perform moderation actions.

   2. Guest Role
      - Guests have limited access to the platform.
      - They can browse and search for products, view product details, and read comments.
      - However, guests cannot add new products, comment, or perform any administrative actions.

## Milestones for Platform Implementation

- [x] **Milestone 1: User Registration and Authentication**

  - [ ] Implement user registration functionality. (t3 not support yet auth.js, so we must implement it manually)
  - [x] Implement user login functionality.
  - [ ] Ensure secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., password hashing, token-based authentication). (t3 not support yet auth.js, so we must implement it manually)
  - [x] Design and develop user-friendly interfaces for registration and login.

- [ ] **Milestone 2: Search and Filtering**

  - [ ] Implement search functionality for products.
  - [ ] Develop filtering options to refine search results.
  - [ ] Design and develop user-friendly interfaces for searching and filtering.

- [ ] **Milestone 3: Product Management**

  - [ ] Develop functionality for users to add new products.
  - [ ] Implement product categorization based on type and origin.
  - [ ] Enable users to verify the accuracy of product information.
  - [ ] Design and develop user-friendly interfaces for adding products and verifying information.

- [ ] **Milestone 4: Community Interaction**

  - [ ] Implement commenting functionality for products.

  - [ ] Design and develop user-friendly interfaces for role-based access control.

- [ ] **Milestone 8: UI Development**

  - [ ] Design and develop a landing page for the platform.
  - [ ] Create user-friendly interfaces for all features and functionalities.

- [ ] **Milestone 9: Testing and Deployment**

  - [ ] Conduct thorough testing of all implemented features.
  - [ ] Fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.
  - [ ] Deploy the platform to a production environment.

- [ ] **Milestone 10: Post-Deployment Monitoring and Maintenance**
  - [ ] Monitor platform performance and user feedback.
  - [ ] Implement necessary updates and improvements based on feedback and performance metrics.

By following these milestones, you can systematically implement and complete the platform.

## Conclusion

This plan outlines the key features and technologies required to build a community-driven platform for boycotting products in support of Palestine. The next steps will involve implementing the various components and testing the platform before deployment.
